          <p className="text-xl w-3/4">
            Itâ€™s now been 3 years since I started programming. I have worked for
            three start-ups in Korea and have developed a few projects as a
            freelancer. I am moving to Shanghai in a few weeks. I love software
            development and recommend this field to all of my friends who are
            interested in finding other opportunities in their life.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl w-3/4">
            I will share my experiences in Shanghai. I also want to write how I
            became a full-stack developer in a relatively short period of time
            by myself, as well as explain my technical interest in software
            development.
